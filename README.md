# SpoMutify

A puny AppleScript (& bash) that mutes Spotify player during ads and gracefully restores the original volume when the songs are back.

# Pre-requisites:
Runs only on Desktop App of Mac OS X (since it uses Dictionary of the Spotify App - No API permissions, nada...)

Make it executable and run it in background. `($ ./MuteSpotify.sh &)`
